Given the current structure of your project, you can focus on creating the `pytorch` package to handle loading and manipulating PyTorch checkpoints. Here's the modified plan specifically for implementing the PyTorch part:

1. Create a new package called `pytorch` inside the `pkg` directory. This package will contain the code for loading and manipulating PyTorch checkpoints.

2. Implement the necessary functions to read PyTorch checkpoint files, which are typically saved in the `.pt` or `.pth` format. These files are serialized using the `torch.save()` function in Python and can be loaded using the `torch.load()` function. You will need to read the file format and deserialize the data into appropriate Go data structures.

3. Define Go structs that represent PyTorch tensors and other necessary components (e.g., dimensions, data types, etc.). These structs will be used to store the deserialized data from the checkpoint files.

4. Implement functions to perform tensor operations and manipulations (e.g., element-wise addition, matrix multiplication, broadcasting, etc.). These functions will be used to perform calculations with the loaded model weights.

5. Integrate the `pytorch` package with the GPT2 model implementation in the `gpt2` package. Update the `LoadGPT2Model` function to use the new `pytorch` package to load the checkpoint and extract the weights.

Here's an outline of the updated package structure and components:

```

```

By following this plan, you can implement the PyTorch model loading and manipulation functionality in Go. However, please note that this is a complex task and may require a significant amount of time and effort. It is generally recommended to use Python or another language with official PyTorch bindings for loading and manipulating PyTorch models.
