The GPT-2 model implementation is located in the `pkg/models/gpt2` directory. A custom implementation of the GPT-2 model has been developed in Go, with various components like attention, layer normalization, and position-wise feed-forward layers implemented in separate files. The model loader is implemented in `loader.go`, which is responsible for loading the GPT-2 model configuration and weights.

The project will use the "gotch" library (https://github.com/sugarme/gotch) as a replacement for PyTorch in Go. The library will be used for tensor operations and GPU support. The `pkg/utils` directory contains utility functions not specific to a particular model.

The goal is to load a pre-trained GPT-2 model saved as a PyTorch checkpoint (pytorch_model.bin) and use it for generating text. The project should be optimized to take advantage of powerful GPUs if available.

The GPT-4 model is being used to assist in this project.
